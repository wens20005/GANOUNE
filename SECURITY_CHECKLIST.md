## üöß REMAINING IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### High Priority (Immediate)

#### 1. Server-Side Implementation
```bash
# Required server endpoints to implement:
POST /api/openai/chat          # Secure OpenAI proxy
POST /api/upload               # Secure file upload
POST /api/security/log         # Security event logging
POST /api/monitoring/errors    # Error logging
POST /api/monitoring/performance # Performance metrics
```

#### 2. Firebase Configuration
```bash
# Deploy security rules to Firebase:
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only storage:rules

# Enable Firebase App Check for additional security
# Configure trusted domains in Firebase Console
```

#### 3. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install additional dependencies:
npm install @playwright/test vitest @vitest/coverage-v8 jsdom typescript
npm install eslint-plugin-security firebase-tools

# Set up Firebase emulators for local testing:
firebase init emulators
```

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

#### 4. Testing Implementation
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical components
- [ ] Implement E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting
- [ ] Create component testing for TTS functionality

#### 5. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Add service worker for offline functionality
- [ ] Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
- [ ] Implement image optimization and lazy loading

#### 6. Accessibility & UX
- [ ] Add ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add screen reader support for TTS features
- [ ] Test with accessibility tools (axe, WAVE)

### Low Priority (Future Releases)

#### 7. Advanced Security Features
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Add API request signing
- [ ] Implement session management
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication support

#### 8. Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Integrate with Sentry for error tracking
- [ ] Add Google Analytics or privacy-focused alternative
- [ ] Implement custom dashboard for monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerting for critical errors

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED

### Data Protection
- ‚úÖ All sensitive data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- ‚úÖ Firebase handles encryption at rest
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- ‚úÖ Secure session management through Firebase Auth

### Input Validation
- ‚úÖ File type and size validation before upload
- ‚úÖ User input sanitization in forms
- ‚úÖ XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- ‚úÖ SQL injection prevention (NoSQL with Firebase)

### Authentication Security
- ‚úÖ Strong password requirements (8+ characters)
- ‚úÖ Secure password reset flow
- ‚úÖ Session timeout and automatic logout
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control

### API Security
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting on API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Authentication required for all API calls
- ‚úÖ Server-side API key management
- ‚úÖ Request/response logging for audit trails

## üìã PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Going Live:
1. [ ] Set up production Firebase project
2. [ ] Configure environment variables in hosting platform
3. [ ] Deploy and test Firebase security rules
4. [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
5. [ ] Configure custom domain with SSL
6. [ ] Test all user flows in production environment
7. [ ] Verify backup and disaster recovery procedures
8. [ ] Complete security penetration testing
9. [ ] Review and update privacy policy with actual contact details
10. [ ] Set up compliance monitoring (GDPR, COPPA if applicable)

### Production Environment Variables:
```env
# Production .env file (hosted securely):
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=prod-firebase-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=prod-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=prod-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=prod-project.appspot.com

NODE_ENV=production
```

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY REMINDERS

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Always use HTTPS** in production
3. **Regularly audit dependencies** for vulnerabilities
4. **Monitor for suspicious activity** in logs
5. **Keep Firebase SDK updated** for security patches
6. **Test security rules thoroughly** before deployment
7. **Implement proper error handling** to avoid information leakage
8. **Use content security policy** to prevent XSS attacks
