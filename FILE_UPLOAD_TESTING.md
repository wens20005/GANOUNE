## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### ✅ **Success Tests**
1. **Valid File Upload**
   - Upload a PDF file (< 10MB)
   - Should see progress bar
   - Should get success notification
   - File should appear as new lesson/exercise

2. **Multiple File Upload**

   - All should upload successfully
   - Each file becomes a separate lesson/exercise

3. **Drag & Drop**
   - Drag files from desktop
   - Upload area should highlight when dragging
   - Files should upload normally

### ❌ **Error Tests**
1. **File Too Large**
   - Try uploading a file > 10MB
   - Should show error: "File size must be less than 10MB"

2. **Invalid File Type**
   - Try uploading an executable (.exe) file
   - Should show error: "File type .exe is not supported"

3. **No File Selected**
   - Click upload without selecting files
   - Should show error: "No file selected"

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### **Firebase Storage (Production)**
```javascript
// In src/firebase.js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com", // Required for uploads
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "your-app-id"
}
```

### **Mock Storage (Testing)**
If Firebase isn't configured, the app automatically uses mock storage:
- Simulates upload progress
- Generates mock download URLs
- Perfect for testing without Firebase setup

## 📱 User Interface Features

### **Upload Component Features**
- ✅ **Drag & Drop Zone** - Visual feedback when dragging files
- ✅ **Progress Bars** - Real-time upload progress for each file
- ✅ **File Previews** - Image thumbnails and file icons
- ✅ **Error Messages** - Clear feedback for upload failures
- ✅ **Success Notifications** - Confirmation when uploads complete
- ✅ **File Validation** - Immediate feedback for invalid files

### **Visual Feedback**
- 🟢 **Green checkmark** - Upload successful
- 🔴 **Red exclamation** - Upload failed
- 🔄 **Loading spinner** - Upload in progress
- 📁 **File icons** - Different icons for file types

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

1. **"Storage quota exceeded"**
   - **Cause**: Firebase storage limit reached
   - **Solution**: Upgrade Firebase plan or clean up old files

2. **"You do not have permission to upload files"**
   - **Cause**: Firebase security rules too restrictive
   - **Solution**: Update Firebase storage rules

3. **"Upload failed" with no specific error**
   - **Cause**: Network connection issues
   - **Solution**: Check internet connection and retry

4. **Files upload but don't appear in UI**
   - **Cause**: Browser cache or state management issue
   - **Solution**: Refresh page or clear browser cache
